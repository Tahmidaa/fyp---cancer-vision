                    Doctors estimate that about 5 to 10 percent of breast cancers are linked to gene mutations passed through generations of a family. Some causes of breast cancer can be:
                    <ul>
                   <li> <b>Being female.</b> Women are much more likely than men are to develop breast cancer.</li>
                   <li> <b>A personal history of breast cancer.</b> If you've had breast cancer in one breast, you have an increased risk of developing cancer in the other breast.</li>
                   <li> <b>A family history of breast cancer.</b> If your mother, sister or daughter was diagnosed with breast cancer, particularly at a young age, your risk of breast cancer is increased. Still, the majority of people diagnosed with breast cancer have no family history of the disease.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                   <li> <b>Inherited genes that increase cancer risk.</b> Certain gene mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer can be passed from parents to children. The most well-known gene mutations are referred to as BRCA1 and BRCA2. These genes can greatly increase your risk of breast cancer and other cancers, but they don't make cancer inevitable.</li>
                   <li> <b>Radiation exposure.</b> If you received radiation treatments to your chest as a child or young adult, your risk of breast cancer is increased.</li>
                   <li> <b>Obesity.</b> Being obese increases your risk of breast cancer.</li>
                   <li> <b>Beginning your period at a younger age.</b> Beginning your period before age 12 increases your risk of breast cancer.</li>
                   <li> <b>Beginning menopause at an older age.</b> If you began menopause at an older age, you're more likely to develop breast cancer. </li>
                   <li> <b>Having your first child at an older age.</b> Women who give birth to their first child after age 30 may have an increased risk of breast cancer.</li>
                   <li> <b>Having never been pregnant.</b> Women who have never been pregnant have a greater risk of breast cancer than do women who have had one or more pregnancies. </li>
                   <li> <b>Postmenopausal hormone therapy.</b> Women who take hormone therapy medications that combine estrogen and progesterone to treat the signs and symptoms of menopause have an increased risk of breast cancer. The risk of breast cancer decreases when women stop taking these medications.

​</li>
                   <li> <b>Drinking alcohol.</b> Drinking alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer.</li>

                    Breast awareness can't prevent breast cancer, but it may help you to better understand the normal changes that your breasts undergo and identify any unusual signs and symptoms.​
                    <ul>
                   <li> <b>Become familiar with your breasts through breast self-exam for breast awareness.</b> Women may choose to become familiar with their breasts by occasionally inspecting their breasts during a breast self-exam for breast awareness. If there is a new change, lumps or other unusual signs in your breasts, talk to your doctor promptly.

​</li>
                   <li> <b>Exercise most days of the week.</b> Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week. If you haven't been active lately, ask your doctor whether it's OK and start slowly.</li>
                   <li> <b>Maintain a healthy weight.</b> If your weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight. If you need to lose weight, ask your doctor about healthy strategies to accomplish this. Reduce the number of calories you eat each day and slowly increase the amount of exercise.</li>
                   <li> <b>Choose a healthy diet.</b> Women who eat a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and mixed nuts may have a reduced risk of breast cancer. The Mediterranean diet focuses mostly on plant-based foods, such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts. People who follow the Mediterranean diet choose healthy fats, such as olive oil, over butter and fish instead of red meat.

​</li>
                   <li> <b>Preventive medications (chemo prevention). </b> Estrogen-blocking medications, such as selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors, reduce the risk of breast cancer in women with a high risk of the disease. These medications carry a risk of side effects, so doctors reserve these medications for women who have a very high risk of breast cancer. Discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor.</li>
                   <li> <b>Preventive surgery. </b> Women with a very high risk of breast cancer may choose to have their healthy breasts surgically removed (prophylactic mastectomy). They may also choose to have their healthy ovaries removed (prophylactic oophorectomy) to reduce the risk of both breast cancer and ovarian cancer.</li>
