                    Anyone can get lung cancer, but 90 percent of lung cancer cases are the result of smoking.

The biggest risk factor for lung cancer is smoking. That includes cigarettes, cigars, and pipes. Tobacco products contain thousands of toxic substances.

From the moment you inhale smoke into your lungs, it starts damaging your lung tissue. The lungs can repair the damage, but continued exposure to smoke makes it increasingly difficult for the lungs to keep up the repair.Once cells are damaged, they begin to behave abnormally, increasing the likelihood of developing lung cancer. Small-cell lung cancer is almost always associated with heavy smoking. When you stop smoking, you lower your risk of lung cancer over time.

​<br>

Other substances that can cause lung cancer are:
                    <ul>
                   <li> arsenic</li>
                   <li> cadmium</li>

                   <li> nickel</li>

                    Exposure to radon, a naturally occurring gas, increases your risk of lung cancer. Radon rises from the ground, entering buildings through small cracks. It’s the leading cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers. A simple home test can tell you if the level of radon in your home is hazardous.
<br>
Your risk of developing lung cancer is higher if you’re exposed to toxic substances such as asbestos or diesel exhaust in the workplace. 
<br>
Other risk factors include:
                    <ul>
                   <li> family history of lung cancer</li>
                   <li> personal history of lung cancer, especially if you’re a smoker</li>

                    There's no sure way to prevent lung cancer, but you can reduce your risk if you:
                    <ul>
                   <li> <b>Don't smoke.</b> If you've never smoked, don't start. Talk to your children about not smoking so that they can understand how to avoid this major risk factor for lung cancer. Begin conversations about the dangers of smoking with your children early so that they know how to react to peer pressure.

​</li>
                   <li> <b>Stop smoking.</b> Stop smoking now. Quitting reduces your risk of lung cancer, even if you've smoked for years. Talk to your doctor about strategies and stop-smoking aids that can help you quit. Options include nicotine replacement products, medications and support groups.

​</li>
                   <li> <b>Avoid secondhand smoke.</b>  If you live or work with a smoker, urge him or her to quit. At the very least, ask him or her to smoke outside. Avoid areas where people smoke, such as bars and restaurants, and seek out smoke-free options.</li>
                   <li> <b>Test your home for radon.</b> Have the radon levels in your home checked, especially if you live in an area where radon is known to be a problem. High radon levels can be remedied to make your home safer. For information on radon testing, contact your local department of public health or a local chapter of the American Lung Association.

​</li>
                   <li> <b>Avoid carcinogens at work. </b> Take precautions to protect yourself from exposure to toxic chemicals at work. Follow your employer's precautions. For instance, if you're given a face mask for protection, always wear it. Ask your doctor what more you can do to protect yourself at work. Your risk of lung damage from workplace carcinogens increases if you smoke.</li>
                   <li> <b>Eat a diet full of fruits and vegetables. </b>  Choose a healthy diet with a variety of fruits and vegetables. Food sources of vitamins and nutrients are best. Avoid taking large doses of vitamins in pill form, as they may be harmful. For instance, researchers hoping to reduce the risk of lung cancer in heavy smokers gave them beta carotene supplements. Results showed the supplements actually increased the risk of cancer in smokers.</li>
                   <li> <b>Exercise most days of the week. </b> If you don't exercise regularly, start out slowly. Try to exercise most days of the week.</li>
